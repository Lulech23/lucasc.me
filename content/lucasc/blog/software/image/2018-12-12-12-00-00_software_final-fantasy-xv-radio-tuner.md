Based on [Vidsquish](https://www.lucasc.me/2018/12/vidsquish.html), **Radio Tuner** is a frontend for a collection of audio libraries that makes it possible to import, export, and replace music from the hit JRPG Final Fantasy XVâ€”specifically, music designed to play while driving the game's featured vehicle, the Regalia.
