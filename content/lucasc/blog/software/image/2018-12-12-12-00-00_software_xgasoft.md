**XGASOFT** is a middleware and game development studio I independently founded in 2017. Its name stands for **International Game Arts**, represented both by its diverse creative influences and its collaborators from all around the world. XGASOFT's mission is **"telling stories with code"**â€”using interactive technologies not just to entertain, but to impact and inspire.  
  
Its first product, **VNgen**, is designed to facilitate just that, putting the power of interactive storytelling in the hands of developers of all skill levels. VNgen is designed to be a great experience for both developers and end users, placing an emphasis on smooth animation and production value previously only achievable on a large budget.

As a game developer, XGASOFT utilizes VNgen and other first-party technologies to create interactive stories of its own such as **_Yugure no Kagami: The Mirror of Dusk_**, a Japan-inspired urban fantasy adventure following the exploits of metaphysical Guardians of the Sun and Moon and the humans who discover their secret existence.
