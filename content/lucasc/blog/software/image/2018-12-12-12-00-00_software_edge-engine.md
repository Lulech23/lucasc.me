**Edge Engine** is a suite of software created from 2014-2016 for GameMaker Studio. It began from a utility I wrote for myself, originally titled [Simple Display Scaler](https://www.lucasc.me/2014/12/simple-display-scaler-now-available.html) before being rebranded as [Edge Display Scaler](https://www.lucasc.me/2016/01/edge-engine-ds.html) some time later. Although it was one of the earliest programs I ever wrote, the utility value of a drag-and-drop scaling solution that worked across all platforms appealed to developers of many skill levels and instantly put my work on the radar. Inspired by this success, I went on to write other tools in the same spirit, culminating in [Edge VN](https://www.lucasc.me/2016/01/edge-engine-vn.html), one of the first fully-featured visual novel engines for GameMaker.

Before GameMaker Studio's EOL in favor of GameMaker Studio 2, Edge Engine was used by hundreds of developers and included in projects spanning a variety of platforms, including PC, Android, iOS, and PlayStation 4. 
  
While it is no longer supported, Edge Engine remains available to download for legacy users on both the GameMaker Marketplace and Itch.io.
