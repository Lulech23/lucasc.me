_The Blood Race_ is a series of YA novels by my good friend [Kate Emmons](http://kaemmons.com). I have a bit of a history with the series already, considering it was written at the same time as I was writing _[Yugure no Kagami: The Mirror of Dusk](http://ynkgame.com)_. Kate and I frequently exchanged drafts of our work, and I knew right away she had landed on something special with [the first book in the series](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Race-Book-1-ebook/dp/B074CQ64NG). Now book two, _[Worlds Beneath](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CPXPFJG/)_, is available in both print and digital, and comes joined by an epic trailer where I voiced the main character!  
  
Voice acting is an art I've always loved but never expected to break into, so I'm extremely grateful I got the opportunity to participate in this project. Be sure to check it out after the jump!
