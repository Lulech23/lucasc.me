 **Hello, world!** Allow me to be the first to welcome you to my personal corner of the web, and to the year 2019!

What's that? I'm not the first to welcome you to the new year? Aw, shucks.

Regardless, if you've followed me around the internet for any length of time, you'll notice quite a few new things around here! What you're looking at isn't just a reskin of an existing site, it's a ground-up rebuild at a new location. Yep, that's right! Just check your address bar! I'll wait.

So, what about the old site? Well, I'll give it to you straight: **effective immediately, the ThinkBoxly brand is being retired**. Sad, I know. It served me well for six years, but at the same time, it also held me back more than it drove me forward. Crafting an identity for ThinkBoxly often meant restricting my own. Switching to a more self-branded approach frees me up to feature more of my work while also going back to my roots, in a way, with the sort of reviews and news commentary ThinkBoxly was originally known for. So yes, while the name itself is gone, the ThinkBoxly spirit will definitely live on.

But never fear: ThinkBoxly _content_ will too. If you check out the [Archive section](https://www.lucasc.me/search/label/ThinkBoxly) in the site menu above, you'll find a **complete collection of everything formerly posted to the old site** throughout its six-year history. All links have been carefully preserved to redirect to the new site as well, so nothing is broken.

Speaking of preservation, you'll notice [that too is a new section](https://www.lucasc.me/search/label/Preservation) in the site menu! In recent years, my interest in keeping old software alive has taken me by surprise. Each new advancement in technology marks an unrepeatable period of history that deserves to be remembered, and I've lived long enough now to have experienced a few of them. And with "software as a service" (or SaaS) now the prevailing model for many enterprises, the task is only getting harder and more necessary.

**Fortunately, I'm not alone in my efforts**. In fact, you could say I stumbled into the preservation community completely by accident. But now that I'm here, I'm proud to do my part.

And of course, **I will also continue developing new software myself**! Moving forward, the majority of my work will be released under the XGASOFT brand, but I also have a habit of releasing little one-off projects on the side. These are just mine, not any brand's, and now you'll find them under the [Software section](https://www.lucasc.me/search/label/Software) in the site menu above. These were a huge omission in the ThinkBoxly days, and I'm proud to finally showcase them under one roof. For example, did you know that in 2018 [I wrote a program](https://www.lucasc.me/2018/12/final-fantasy-xv-radio-tuner.html) that got reported on by Kotaku, Rock, Paper, Shotgun, GeForce.com, and many other gaming media outlets? It's true!

And this is just a taste of what to expect. If any of that sounds interesting to you, I hope you'll consider sticking around! **To 2019, and beyond!** âœŠ
