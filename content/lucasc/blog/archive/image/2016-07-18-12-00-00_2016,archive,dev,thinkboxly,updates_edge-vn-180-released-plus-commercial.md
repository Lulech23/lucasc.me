Edge Engine's flagship module has reached its biggest milestone yet, and in more ways than one! For the past few months Edge VN has been receiving major updates to overhaul every aspect of the visual novel suite and bring to it a new level of features, performance, and stability. Now that quest is complete, and on top of that, one of the first commercial visual novels built on Edge VN is now available to the public!  
  

### A New Edge VN

The last version of Edge VN, 1.7.0, was one of the biggest single leaps the module made since its inception. The new 1.8.0 update finishes what it started with even more overhauls, feature updates, unifying of existing elements, and performance improvements.  
  
Here's the full list of updates to this version of Edge VN:  
  
• Updated edgevn\_create\_text to set the drawing font, enabling variable fonts per string. The text font parameter  
in edgevn\_draw\_text is now an override and can be disabled  
  
• Added optional auto ID mode to edgevn\_create\_text and edgevn\_create\_char  
  
• Added option to edgevn\_create\_text to enable or disable breaking between strings to facilitate ‘NVL’-style  
visual novel presentation  
  
• Added passive parallax mode to scenes, enabling scenes to offset other scenes for enhanced effect  
  
• Rewritten textbox script brings code up to parity with recent updates—adds style modification features and effects to  
textboxes just like characters and scenes!  
  
• Updated edgevn\_draw\_char\_ext to syntactical parity with scene and textbox effects, including a new ‘loop’  
option (also applies to edgevn\_char\_style\_ext)  
  
• Added option to audio functions to stop sound if target string is skipped before sound is finished playing  
  
• Added basic backtracking support to edgevn\_goto  
  
• Improved touch screen support for reference links (see documentation on mobile device support)  
  
• Renamed edgevn\_prepare\_block to edgevn\_init\_block for clarity and uniformity with other Edge  
Engine modules  
  
• Added support for # line breaking  
  
• General additional improvements and bug fixes
