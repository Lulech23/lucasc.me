If you hadn't noticed, things have looked a bit different around here at ThinkBoxly for a few weeks now! While the latest version of ThinkBoxly was released to less fanfare than usual, it was for good reason--that reason being, the reasons for the updates had to be kept under wraps! While some of those reasons must remain secrets for a while longer, today the first step of those plans comes to completion: Edge Engine is now fully assimilated into ThinkBoxly, and ALL modules have received updates to help them settle into their new home and just be better than ever before! Note the change in URL in particular--Edge Engine can now be found at **[thinkboxly.com](https://lucasc.me/)**, NOT edgeengine.net! In less than a month that domain will expire, so take your time but be sure to point your browser to the new location from now on to receive support and news of updates! What sort of updates? Read on to find out!  
  

### A New Paradigm

First of all, to simplify and better strategize development, Edge Engine has been reorganized into three separate categories of modules: Systems, Utilities, and Features. I highly recommend checking out [thinkboxly.com](https://docs.xgasoft.com) to learn more, but in short, from now on each Edge Engine module will be assigned a color code indicating its general usage and size. With the new scheme in place identifying modules at a glance is easy, plus it creates a good environment for the engine to grow in the future.  
  

### Fixes and Features All Around!

More importantly, however, is updates to all premium modules. There are currently five of them out in the wild, plus the free [make\_color\_hex](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/1715/make-color-hex-edge-engine) script. As part of the transition from Edge Engine as its own entity to being an integral part of ThinkBoxly, each one has been improved for February in some pretty big ways. Check out the full list of changes and updates for yourself below! And of course, you can always check out more details for each module and full documentation online by heading over to [the Edge Engine 'learn more' page](http://lucasc.me/search/Edge%20Engine).

That's it for this month, but stay tuned! There are many, many more exciting things coming this 2016! Thanks for being a part of the journey!
