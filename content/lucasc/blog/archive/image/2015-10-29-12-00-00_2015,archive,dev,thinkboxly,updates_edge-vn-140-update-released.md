Edge VN 1.3.0 was a defining moment for Edge Engine, and ever since that major release Edge VN has been focused on becoming as rock solid as possible to support new features with reliable functionality. First 1.3.6 provided sweeping improvements, and now 1.4.0 builds on what it started for the best version of Edge VN yet!  
  
The 1.4.0 release packs numerous under-the-hood fixes and code cleanups to ensure the smoothest experience possible, and also adds yet another new feature: the ability to hide/show on-screen text! Visual novels are designed to pride themselves on artwork, and now Edge VN users will be able to enjoy characters and scenery free from obstruction while still enjoying voice acted dialog (if any) for a highly cinematic visual novel experience.  
  
Because 1.4.0 represents the peak of a string of major updates, a new demo video has been created showcasing all the new features introduced since 1.3.0. Check it out!
