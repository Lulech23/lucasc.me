For the past year-and-a-half since Edge Engine's inception, ThinkBoxly has been providing not only powerful tools for budding game developers, but also extensive learning resources to assist in using them effectively. However, up until now this documentation was limited to PDF files that were difficult to search locally and unwieldy to embed online. But with a new addition to the site, available live today, all that is going to change. Please welcome [docs.thinkboxly.com](https://docs.xgasoft.com/), aka ThinkBoxly Docs!  
  
ThinkBoxly Docs is a hub for all ThinkBoxly products, specifically Edge Engine. Full documentation is available for reading online and for free download in PDF format. With the new site, reference resources are always at your fingertips no matter what device you're using. Have questions that aren't answered in the documentation? ThinkBoxly Docs also features a simple feedback system on every item, giving users the chance to voice their opinions and by consequence shape the available information into the most helpful resources possible.  
  
Documentation is now available for Edge Display Scaler, Edge Filesystem, Edge FMV, Edge Splash Screen, and the Edge Visual Novel Engine.
