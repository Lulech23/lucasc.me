If you've been following the development of Edge Engine for any length of time, you're probably expecting the next module announcement to be that of Edge UI. Well, when inspiration comes knocking, it's usually a good idea to answer, and in this case development of Edge UI was temporarily put on hold for the development of a pair of super-secret experimental projects, one of which is experimental and super-secret no more. In fact, it's available right now!  
  

## Introducing: Edge Engine Filesystem!

  
Edge Engine Filesystem, or Edge FS for short, is a new Edge Engine module designed to make save and load operations as easy and robust as possible. A single script can save and encrypt virtually every data type supported by GameMaker Studio, and additional scripts provide even more layers of information to complete the package. And yes, I did say **encryption**\--just saving files is all well and good, but what if you don't want users of your applications fiddling with the settings outside of the program? That's where Edge FS comes in with both encryption and obfuscation. All data files are easy to work with for developers, but difficult to tamper with. Because all filesystem operations are handled by Edge FS, all you have to concentrate on is telling it what to read and write. There's plenty of additional features too, such as detailed timestamps that are accurate to the microsecond, and save file screenshots so you can see what you're getting into before even loading anything!  
  
Sound interesting? [Edge FS is available on the Marketplace now](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/2488/save-load-system-edge-engine), and documentation is always available online [right here at thinkboxly.com](https://lucasc.me/post/edge-fs-save-load-and-encryption) on the [Edge Engine](https://docs.xgasoft.com/) page.  
  
Thanks for your support of Edge Engine, and here's to many more modules to come!
