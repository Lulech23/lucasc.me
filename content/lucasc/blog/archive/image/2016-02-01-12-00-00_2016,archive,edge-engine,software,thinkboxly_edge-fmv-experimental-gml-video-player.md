Note that traditional video formats (.mp4, .avi, etc) are not supported. These formats must be converted for playback with Edge FMV using the included MakeFMV custom video conversion application **(now with GUI!)**. Also note that due to performance limitations only one video may be played at a time.  
  
**Warning: this asset is experimental and likely always will be. It is intended for advanced users only, and may not perform as expected due to limitations within GameMaker Studio.**
