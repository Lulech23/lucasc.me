Another weekend, another update to Edge Engine, this time again for the popular Edge Display Scaler. The new 1.2.8 update builds off of what was introduced in 1.2.6, improving support for mobile devices with super high-resolution screens exceeding GameMaker Studio's 2K limitation, as well as dramatically improving the performance of both single-axis and forced-resolution scaling scripts.  
  
On capable PCs the FPS gain will likely be relatively insignificant, but mobile devices should see gains of up to 1,000% over 1.2.6, depending on the hardware and target resolution. On top of all that, 1.2.8 also packs a few minor other improvements and bug fixes.  
  
You all know what to do: it's updating time!
