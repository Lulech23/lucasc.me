A new update has been published for Edge VN adding two minor, but important features to the new branching dialog options system:  
  
1) Text options can now continue on in the current text block rather than create new text blocks by necessity, and  
  
2) Text options can trigger jumping to a specific string of text within the target text block.  
  
This does mean the addition of a new argument to edgevn\_draw\_options, so be sure to update your code accordingly. Check the built-in syntax guides or the [updated documentation](https://docs.xgasoft.com) for more details, and as always head on over to the [marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/publishers/603/thinkboxly) or your Game Maker Studio asset library to grab the update for yourself!
