Remember when CES and E3 were all us tech fanatics had to look forward to every year? Now it seems like every company has their own press conferences and shows. Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft, Activision—all throughout the year now we get these smaller displays focused on just one company at a time. But up until now there hasn’t really been anything on the Sony side, or more specifically, the Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) side. Enter Playstation Experience, an annual event which debuted this past weekend doubling as a celebration of PlayStation’s 20th anniversary. And oh boy, what an event it was. Riding high off the unstoppable momentum of the Playstation 4, Playstation fans have never been more proud to be Playstation fans. Heck, there were even a number of former Xbox fans in attendance who were proud to be Playstation fans. Not to say that Microsoft isn’t doing well at all—in fact, the Xbox One has grown into quite the worthy purchase—but with Playstation Experience (or PSX for short) Sony effectively reminded everyone who’s stuck with Playstation over the years what has kept them continually coming back. PSX was about Playstation and Playstation games, absolutely, but it was also something more than that. Not every game on display was new or yet to be released, and that’s because PSX wasn’t so much a press conference as it was a fan conference. There were numerous competitions, Q & A sessions featuring SCE and top third-party staff, and even a story time session to close things out, where we got a little inside look into SCE and how it works as a company. It was a surprisingly casual event in many respects, and yet it never lost that great Sony class. This was an event by gamers for gamers who share a common love for all things Playstation—not a two-day-long advertisement. It was a great time, and I’m more excited about what 2015 holds for us gamers than ever.

Because yes, there were games on display at PSX. Lots of them. Sony’s got a strong trio on their hands with the PS3, PS4, and PS Vita, and there’s plenty of great content to keep you busy on all three. I should know—after the event, I finally caved in and picked up a PS4 in anticipation of 2015, which is right around the corner, now. You can see my unboxing of that console at the head of this post. For all the rest, check out the full list of games that made some appearance at PSX below.
