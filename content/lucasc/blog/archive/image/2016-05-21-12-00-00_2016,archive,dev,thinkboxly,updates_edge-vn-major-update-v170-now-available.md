If you've been using Edge VN for the past few months, you'll have noticed that it has sat at v1.5.4 for a while now. As of today, I'm very proud to unveil the reason why: v1.7.0 is now here, and as the leap in version number suggests, it's a big one! The new update completely overhauls the code from previous versions and adds a plethora of new features, making this the cleanest and best version of Edge VN yet! Read on to find out what's new:  
  
Version 1.7.0 of Edge VN features:  
  
• Migrated all drawing functions to the Draw GUI event (Warning: this could affect projects made using previous versions of Edge VN!)  
  
• Rewritten scene engine—now cleaner, easier to use, and includes optional parallax effect with characters!  
  
• Added edgevn\_create\_next\_block script for easily stringing multiple text blocks together  
  
• Added character scaling and transparency options to edgevn\_char\_style  
  
• Added audio functions for playing sounds and music within the context of Edge VN events  
  
• Added edgevn\_toggle\_pause script for pausing/unpausing most engine functions  
  
• Auto mode now pauses when game loses focus  
  
• Added basic support for RTL (right-to-left) languages (text blocks only; log not supported)  
  
• Fixed a bug causing crashes when typewriter mode is not enabled  
  
• Minor additional bug fixes  
  
• Numerous additional minor improvements  
  
• Code cleanup and enhancements for efficiency and readability  
  
If any of that sounds interesting to you, be sure to [check out Edge VN on the Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/1591/visual-novel-edge-engine) or download the latest update from your GameMaker asset library if you already own it! As this is such a major update, converting old projects will take more effort than usual, so you'll also want to be sure to [check out the documentation](https://lucasc.me/post/edge-vn-advanced-visual-novel-engine) for the migration guide and all the latest notes on all the updated scripts.
