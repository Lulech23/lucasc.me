Well folks, it’s that time of year again! The annual Consumer Electronics Show is back for another busy week of tech reveals from all sorts of your favorite companies around the world. Kicking off the show tonight at 8:00pm PST is NVIDIA, and as something of a last minute decision, ThinkBoxly will be covering the event live, right here on this very post! The feed you see below is in something of a highly experimental stage, so cross your fingers that all goes well and perhaps you’ll see other CES events covered this week too!  
  
So with that out of the way, sit back, relax, and stay tuned to ThinkBoxly throughout the show tonight!
