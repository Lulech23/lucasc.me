It's hard to believe almost a year has passed since XGASOFT's main site first went live, and along with it, the unveiling of [Yugure no Kagami](http://www.ynkgame.com/) to the world. Since then, however, my development efforts have been laser-focused on completing [VNgen](https://www.xga.one/vngen), the engine designed to make it possible. It might've looked like nothing was happening, but the planets are aligning and it's time for that to change.  
  
And change it has: [xgasoft.com](https://www.xgasoft.com/) has been completely revamped from backend to frontend, and is about to see a lot more activity very soon. As described [in a previous devblog post](https://lucasc.me/post/update-33-end-of-beginning), future development updates will be featured by XGASOFT, leaving ThinkBoxly for more personal content instead. What's more, you can now [subscribe to receive XGASOFT updates](https://www.xgasoft.com/) by email and receive 10% your next purchase of any XGASOFT product (like VNgen)!  
  
And speaking of VNgen, keep your eyes peeled for a new update hitting the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/6083/vngen-visual-novel-engine) and [Itch.io](https://xgasoft.itch.io/vngen) this weekend! Feedback and development have both continued post-1.0, and the new version contains multiple fixes to text and vox actions, plus adds easier NVL-style presentation with auto text positioning.  
  
And... that's about it for now! A bit of an abbreviated post this weekend, I know, but for good reason. What reason? Stay tuned to find out soon at [XGASOFT](https://www.xgasoft.com/)!
