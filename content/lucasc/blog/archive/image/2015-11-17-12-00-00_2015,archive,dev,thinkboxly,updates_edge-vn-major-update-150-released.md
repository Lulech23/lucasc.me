Never say never...  
  
Edge VN has been making major strides ever since version 1.3.0, and strap on your seatbelts, because while 1.4.0 was intended to be the end of this streak, Edge VN isn't done looking up yet! 1.5.0 is now out in the wild and packing even bigger upgrades than 1.4.0!  
  
Literally every aspect of Edge VN was carefully re-evaluated and edited to make 1.5.0 as solid and user-friendly as possible. A few components were even nearly re-programmed in their entirety for even simpler and more efficient operation than ever before. The changelog is a long one this time around, so be sure to check out [the Edge VN documentation](https://lucasc.me/post/edge-vn-advanced-visual-novel-engine) for full details! And as always, you can also [check out the Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/1591/visual-novel-edge-engine) for more info and to get Edge VN for yourself, and existing users can download the update straight from their GameMaker Studio Libraries. You won't want to miss this one!
